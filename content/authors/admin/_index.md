## About Me

My name is Sambit Sahoo and I am currently wrapping up my Master's in Computer Science. I am driven by a passion for transforming data into actionable insights. My research interests include data curation and artificial intelligence. In the Spring 2025 semester, I will be researching about methods for data curation on incomplete data.

I have conducted natural language processing research by utilizing a Latent-Dirichlet Allocation model to differentiate between statements and opinionated comments in a COVID-19 medical docket. More recently, I researched the effectiveness of the ONE-PEACE model for tasks like language-queried audio source separation.
